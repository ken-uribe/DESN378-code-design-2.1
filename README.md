## About This Repository

This is my workspace for **DESN 378 Code + Design 2** also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**) at Eastern Washington University. **The question this course asks:** How should things behave? In DESN 368, I learned how to make things look right. Here, I'm learning how to make things behave right — treating code as a design material with properties, behaviors, and constraints, just like paint, paper, or clay. Throughout the quarter, I'll work with four digital materials: CSS systems, SVG, animation libraries, and generative code — learning how each responds to manipulation and what each makes possible. Unlike courses focused on user research or backend engineering, this one asks: How does it feel? By the end, this repo will become my portfolio.

## Learning Log

Update this section each week with observations, breakthroughs, and questions.
​
## Week 0
​
### What I Learned
Learned about Variables, Data structures, Loops, Conditionals, and Functions.
Varibales are containers that hold values and other data types.
Objects can either change or be const( can't be changed later on).
Learned about functions and how they allow you to create reusable & modular code.
Functions afect variables inside them. If you define a variable within a function, 
the variable cannot be used outside the function. JavaScript has to do with  manipulation,
interaction with the user, & the webserver. 
​
​
### What Was Hard
The hard part was remembering what objects were given so that they could be strung together,
like in the greeting bot assignment.
​
​
### How I Used AI
I used AI to help explain some parts since I named some of my files differently and had to
fix them in the code. It also helped break down and find where the errors were since it can 
be hard to find them when you are tiered.
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
This is from the reading we originally had before it changed, but I'm still not sure about the 
2 ways to access a value inside an object. And the use of brackets and dot notation.

​

## Project Structure
- `css/` — Stylesheets
- `scripts/` — JavaScript
- `assets/` — Images, fonts, icons, etc.
​
## Changes This Week
- Migrated to standardized structure

### Week 2: Remembering Choices
# Learning Log
​
## Week 2
​
### What I Learned
Design Systems are a set of standards that help keep the look/feel
of products & experiences consistant. Components of a design system
three main parts: 1. Design System= the entier ecosystem 2. Componet
& Pattern Libraries 3. Foundational Elements/Style Guide
Reasons to use a design system being, working with a team, working
faster, and creating more engagment/loyalty with it.
​
### What Was Hard
The hardest part is learning about Design Tokens and the naming systems
for them. I can definetly see how they will speed work up once they are
set and able to be plugged in.​
​
### How I Used AI
I used it to create a story for the Story Teller HW. I need to use it 
more to not just explain, but to also check where I went wrong or might
be doing wrong.​
​
### What's Still Unclear
It's a me thing, and it's naming and getting the right links/paths so that
the code works properly.
