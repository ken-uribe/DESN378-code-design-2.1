## About This Repository

This is my workspace for **DESN 378 Code + Design 2** also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**) at Eastern Washington University. **The question this course asks:** How should things behave? In DESN 368, I learned how to make things look right. Here, I'm learning how to make things behave right — treating code as a design material with properties, behaviors, and constraints, just like paint, paper, or clay. Throughout the quarter, I'll work with four digital materials: CSS systems, SVG, animation libraries, and generative code — learning how each responds to manipulation and what each makes possible. Unlike courses focused on user research or backend engineering, this one asks: How does it feel? By the end, this repo will become my portfolio.

# Learning Log
​
## Week 5
​
### What I Learned
SVG primatives are pretty easy to understand now. It's just sometimes
a little difficult to remenber to remember to switch to the right attributs
that go with the type of SVG. Paths can get a little messy looking in code,
especially if they get really long. I also wondered if there was a way to
close the paths (which is z at the end), so it's easier to think of it as
a shape/line. the different types of animations that they can have were
interesting, and I got a little excited when I got the star from the SVG
tutoral practice to spin on the click.
​
​
### What Was Hard
Arcs took a little and I think I still struggle to get how to make it work
correctly (math is hard if you don't practice it). Also how long Paths in 
general can get, and thinking of how to best write it neatly so that it is
understandable (for me rn). Also, still struggling with remembering the right
JS comands to get things to work (like the drop down). I struggled really hard
with the drop down, and I tried to move things around to play with it but 
found I messed it up badly and it took me a while to get it to work like
the computer had it, without coping it exactly again.​
​
### How I Used AI
I ask ChatGPT a lot rn, I'm still thinking of a way to prompt better, but
so that it will still teach me what it's doing and how it's doing code when
I get stuck. I feel like I'm going to have to ask it a lot of questions for
this next project, but I feel like it's mainly going to be to remind me of
how to write/use the right attributes. I think I get the concepts for JS.​
​
### What's Still Unclear
ViewBox in SVGs. I get it's the window and can act like a mask for SVGs,
but it's still unclear of how I would know what size I need for each?
I'm going to assume that it's practice and messing with it though.

​
## Week 0
​
### What I Learned
Learned about Variables, Data structures, Loops, Conditionals, and Functions.
Varibales are containers that hold values and other data types.
Objects can either change or be const( can't be changed later on).
Learned about functions and how they allow you to create reusable & modular code.
Functions afect variables inside them. If you define a variable within a function, 
the variable cannot be used outside the function. JavaScript has to do with  manipulation,
interaction with the user, & the webserver. 
​
​
### What Was Hard
The hard part was remembering what objects were given so that they could be strung together,
like in the greeting bot assignment.
​
​
### How I Used AI
I used AI to help explain some parts since I named some of my files differently and had to
fix them in the code. It also helped break down and find where the errors were since it can 
be hard to find them when you are tiered.
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
This is from the reading we originally had before it changed, but I'm still not sure about the 
2 ways to access a value inside an object. And the use of brackets and dot notation.

### Week 2: Remembering Choices
# Learning Log
​
## Week 2
​
### What I Learned
Design Systems are a set of standards that help keep the look/feel
of products & experiences consistant. Components of a design system
three main parts: 1. Design System= the entier ecosystem 2. Componet
& Pattern Libraries 3. Foundational Elements/Style Guide
Reasons to use a design system being, working with a team, working
faster, and creating more engagment/loyalty with it.
​
### What Was Hard
The hardest part is learning about Design Tokens and the naming systems
for them. I can definetly see how they will speed work up once they are
set and able to be plugged in.​
​
### How I Used AI
I used it to create a story for the Story Teller HW. I need to use it 
more to not just explain, but to also check where I went wrong or might
be doing wrong.​
​
### What's Still Unclear
It's a me thing, and it's naming and getting the right links/paths so that
the code works properly.

# Learning Log
​
## Week 3
​
### What I Learned
Learned more about naming conventions & design tokens.
How to best implement them and when they should be used or when
would be a good time to use them so that they can later on be 
scaled up. ​
​
### What Was Hard
Hard part was understanding some of the assignments since some are
copy and past from past assignmets/AI so I get confused on what to do
or submit, but I think I'm getting the main points done for the big picture.​
​
### How I Used AI
I used it again to help explain some parts and troubleshooting. I also have
been having to use it to speed things up with coding. I do have to go back and
read it since I want to make sure that what I do code I understand.​
​
### What's Still Unclear
Lots of things, but I check in with others to see if I'm in the ballpark.
Also still wondering how we will grab from figma and turn it to code. Probably
thinking it will deal with the dev mode portion to creat the CSS.

## Week 4
# Learning Log
​
## Week 
​
### What I Learned
Learned about SVGs and how simple ones can be used to create icons
and buttons. SVG code goes in the HTML body and can be animated in
CSS. SVGs are created by points and are scalable instead of static.
Depending on the shape different atributes will change the element 
(<circle><rect><line><polygon><ellipse>).​
​
### What Was Hard
I'm actually still haveing a hard time with testing in the console,
but I think it's just lack of practice, and my bad decition in trying
to create a new portfolio page, and not making up my mind on how I want
it. I keep changing my mind. I'm going to just pick something and stick
with it even if I don't like it.​
​
### How I Used AI
I used it a lot for explaining, and heoping me catch up on some things.
I am making sure I have it explain each step or explain parts that come
up that I haven't seen or been taught in class, sometimes the machine likes
to add things because it's faster, but we haven' t learned about it yet or
at all.​
​
### What's Still Unclear
I sometimes still get a little confused on where you want certain code to go.
But I'm definetly starting to understand better with the none AI slides.
