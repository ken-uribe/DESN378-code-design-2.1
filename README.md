### Step 4: Your Workspace Is Ready

The starter files are already set up:

```
index.html          ← Your Learning Log will grow here
css/styles.css      ← Your styles
scripts/main.js     ← Your JavaScript (starts Week 1)
```

Your `index.html` will evolve week by week as you learn. By the end of the quarter, we will update it and the repo becomes your portfolio.

**What about your DESN 368 portfolio?**
Keep it where it is for now. We'll address portfolio consolidation later in the quarter. This weekend, you'll do a peer audit to assess the current state of your work.
