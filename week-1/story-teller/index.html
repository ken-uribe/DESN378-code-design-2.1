    <h2>1. Meet Little Bear</h2>
    <img src="assets/images/IMG_2.png" alt="Small brown bear cub playing in a forest">
    <p>In a cozy forest near a wide blue river lived a little bear named Milo.<br>
      Milo was the smallest in his bear family. His paws were tiny, and his roar sounded more like a squeak.
      <br>
      Sometimes Milo wondered,
      <i>“Can I really help? I'm so small.”</i>
      <br>
      Mama Bear hugged him and said,
      <i>“Every bear matters in our community.”</i>
      <br>
      Milo wasn't sure what that meant yet.

    <h2>2. The Busy Bear Community</h2>
    <img src="assets/images/IMG_3.png" alt="Small brown bear cub sniffing a stone they are on.">
    <p>One morning, Milo walked through the forest village with his family.
      <br>
      He saw:
      <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Baker Bear sharing honey bread</li>
      <br>
      <li>Builder Bear fixing a broken bridge</li>
      <br>
      <li>Grandma Bear telling stories to the cubs</li>
      <br>
      <li>Everyone had something to do.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Milo watched and thought,
    <i>“I can't bake or build like them.”</i>
    <br>
    He felt a little too small.

    <h2>3. A Problem in the Forest</h2>
    <img src="assets/images/IMG_4.png" alt="Small brown bear cub looking concerned.">
    <p>That afternoon, dark clouds rolled in.
      Rain poured down, and the river grew fast and loud.
      <br>
      Twigs and leaves blocked the path to the berry patch.
      The bigger bears tried to move them, but the path was too narrow.
      <br>
      Milo noticed something important.
      His small paws could fit where the others couldn't.

    <h2>4. Little Bear Helps</h2>
    <img src="assets/images/IMG_5.png" alt="Small brown bear cub with mother.">
    <p>Milo squeezed through the tight path and gently moved the twigs away.
      He called out directions so the other bears knew where to step.
      <br>
      Soon, the path was clear again!
      <br>
      The bears cheered.
      Papa Bear smiled and said,
      <i>“Your small size helped our whole community.”</i>
      <br>
      Milo felt warm and proud inside.

    <h2 class="Part5">5. Everyone Matters</h2>
    <img src="assets/images/IMG_6.png" alt="Small brown bear cub playing.">
    <p>
      That night, the bear family shared berries under the stars.
      <br>
      Milo finally understood.
      Community means helping each other, big or small.
      <br>
      He whispered,
      <i>“I'm part of this.”</i>
      <br>
      Mama Bear smiled and said,
      “And you always will be.”
      <br>
      Milo fell asleep knowing that even a little bear can make a big difference.
