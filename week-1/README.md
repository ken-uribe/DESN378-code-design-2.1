# Learning Log
​
## Week 6-7
​
### What I Learned
<!-- SVG's, dropdown, svg paths --> SVG's 
SVG's are not as intimidating if you don't have to make them from scratch.
It is very tedious to do from scratch, but still doable. The dropdown was
interesting to do, I had some trouble with it since it wouldn't line up right
until I figured out the parenting and position it needed to be. The SVG's that
I created were a little difficult to adjust, but worked out. SVG paths were
very usefull, especially if you wanted more organic/detailed shapes.

For WK 7 GSAP had a lot of information for animation. I found myself writting a
lot of notes and then decided to stop because I was writting too much and
wasn't learning as much, I think breaking that up would help more, maybe into
two section chunks so that notes can be taken. Pralax was decent to understand
and grasp as a concept since we see it a lot in digital media.
​
​
### What Was Hard
<!-- What broke, confused you, or took time to understand -->
I was a little confused and still a little confused on the animation of SVG's,
mainly in the part that I want to combine a lot of animations together in one
go. I still struggle with breaking things down and going slow. As well as reading
the parts that I need to change to customize the animations and make them feel
smoother.​
​
### How I Used AI
<!-- Copilot, ChatGPT, etc. What you asked and why -->
I definetly had to use ChatGPT to help break down things and to better explain
when it came to learning about timelines. I understood it, but sometimes it's 
difficult to remember all the parts that go into it so that it works. Plus, I 
have a habit of adding the same const again because I forget I used it at the
top/above code, so it helps catch it and take the extras out.​
​
### What's Still Unclear
<!-- Questions that remain -->
Timelines, I think it's a remembering thing, I'm just not the greatest at remebering
when it comes to code so I have to many notes I have to reference often. Also, figuring
out the correct cascade so that the code works correctly. Still hasn't fully clicked...

## Week 5
​
### What I Learned
SVG primatives are pretty easy to understand now. It's just sometimes
a little difficult to remenber to remember to switch to the right attributs
that go with the type of SVG. Paths can get a little messy looking in code,
especially if they get really long. I also wondered if there was a way to
close the paths (which is z at the end), so it's easier to think of it as
a shape/line. the different types of animations that they can have were
interesting, and I got a little excited when I got the star from the SVG
tutoral practice to spin on the click.
​
​
### What Was Hard
Arcs took a little and I think I still struggle to get how to make it work
correctly (math is hard if you don't practice it). Also how long Paths in 
general can get, and thinking of how to best write it neatly so that it is
understandable (for me rn). Also, still struggling with remembering the right
JS comands to get things to work (like the drop down). I struggled really hard
with the drop down, and I tried to move things around to play with it but 
found I messed it up badly and it took me a while to get it to work like
the computer had it, without coping it exactly again.​
​
### How I Used AI
I ask ChatGPT a lot rn, I'm still thinking of a way to prompt better, but
so that it will still teach me what it's doing and how it's doing code when
I get stuck. I feel like I'm going to have to ask it a lot of questions for
this next project, but I feel like it's mainly going to be to remind me of
how to write/use the right attributes. I think I get the concepts for JS.​
​
### What's Still Unclear
ViewBox in SVGs. I get it's the window and can act like a mask for SVGs,
but it's still unclear of how I would know what size I need for each?
I'm going to assume that it's practice and messing with it though.

## Week 4
# Learning Log
​
## Week 
​
### What I Learned
Learned about SVGs and how simple ones can be used to create icons
and buttons. SVG code goes in the HTML body and can be animated in
CSS. SVGs are created by points and are scalable instead of static.
Depending on the shape different atributes will change the element 
(<circle><rect><line><polygon><ellipse>).​
​
### What Was Hard
I'm actually still haveing a hard time with testing in the console,
but I think it's just lack of practice, and my bad decition in trying
to create a new portfolio page, and not making up my mind on how I want
it. I keep changing my mind. I'm going to just pick something and stick
with it even if I don't like it.​
​
### How I Used AI
I used it a lot for explaining, and heoping me catch up on some things.
I am making sure I have it explain each step or explain parts that come
up that I haven't seen or been taught in class, sometimes the machine likes
to add things because it's faster, but we haven' t learned about it yet or
at all.​
​
### What's Still Unclear
I sometimes still get a little confused on where you want certain code to go.
But I'm definetly starting to understand better with the none AI slides.

## Week 3
​
### What I Learned
Learned more about naming conventions & design tokens.
How to best implement them and when they should be used or when
would be a good time to use them so that they can later on be 
scaled up. ​
​
### What Was Hard
Hard part was understanding some of the assignments since some are
copy and past from past assignmets/AI so I get confused on what to do
or submit, but I think I'm getting the main points done for the big picture.​
​
### How I Used AI
I used it again to help explain some parts and troubleshooting. I also have
been having to use it to speed things up with coding. I do have to go back and
read it since I want to make sure that what I do code I understand.​
​
### What's Still Unclear
Lots of things, but I check in with others to see if I'm in the ballpark.
Also still wondering how we will grab from figma and turn it to code. Probably
thinking it will deal with the dev mode portion to creat the CSS.

## Week 2
​
### What I Learned
Design Systems are a set of standards that help keep the look/feel
of products & experiences consistant. Components of a design system
three main parts: 1. Design System= the entier ecosystem 2. Componet
& Pattern Libraries 3. Foundational Elements/Style Guide
Reasons to use a design system being, working with a team, working
faster, and creating more engagment/loyalty with it.
​
### What Was Hard
The hardest part is learning about Design Tokens and the naming systems
for them. I can definetly see how they will speed work up once they are
set and able to be plugged in.​
​
### How I Used AI
I used it to create a story for the Story Teller HW. I need to use it 
more to not just explain, but to also check where I went wrong or might
be doing wrong.​
​
### What's Still Unclear
It's a me thing, and it's naming and getting the right links/paths so that
the code works properly.
